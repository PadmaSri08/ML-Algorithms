Classification:
In machine learning, classification is a supervised learning technique used to predict the category or class to which a data point belongs. It involves training a model on labeled data to identify patterns and relationships between input features and target classes, enabling it to assign new data points to the correct category
Regression:
It is also a supervised learning technique used to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features. It involves identifying relationships between independent and dependent variables to forecast outcomes. Essentially, regression aims to model the connection between variables and predict continuous values.
